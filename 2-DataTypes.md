# Data Types in Javascript

## Javascript - A dynamically typed language

Javascript is what you would call a *dynamically typed language*. What that means is a variable in Javascript can hold any type of value. To draw some context, in other statically typed languages like C, C++ or Java, you are required to specify what *type* of value a variable you are creating can hold.

In C, if you want to create a variable,

```C
int a = 10;

a = 20; // This operation is allowed since 20 is a integer too.
a = 'Hello World!' // This operation will throw an error, since it's a string
```

In Javascript, there is no such requirement. The *let* keyword can be used to hold any type of value.

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 10.5;
let c = "Hola Amigo!";

// All valid operations! ðŸŽ‰
```

## Data Types

While variables in Javascript don't have types, the values that you store in them do. What that means is the a value stored in a variable can be of the following types:

- `number` (A numeric value like `10` or `5.5`)
- `boolean` (A conditional value like `true` or `false`)
- `string` (A character or string value like `'Hey'`)
- `undefined` (An `undefined` value)
- `object` (An aggregate value of properties and values)

### number

A value of type `number` is any numeric value. There is not distinction in Javascript between integers and floating point numbers as in other languages. Whether the value is `5` or `5.5`, both are deemed to be of type `number`.

```javascript
let a = 10; // Value is of type number
a = 4.5; // Value is still of type number
```

### boolean

A value of type `boolean` can either be `true` or `false`. Boolean values are also called the logical type since its primary use is for logical operations. A boolean value is usually the outcome of a comparison operation.

```javascript
let yes = true;
let no = false;

let answer = 4 > 5;

console.log(answer); // This will print false to the console.

answer = 5 > 4;

console.log(answer); // This will print true to the console.
```

### string

A value of type `string` is any character or string of characters. There are three ways you can denote a string value

- Using single quotes, `'Hi ðŸ‘‹'`
- Using double quotes, `"Hi ðŸ‘‹"`
- Using backticks, <code>\`Hi ðŸ‘‹\`</code>

```javascript
let first = 'Charmander';
let second = "Charmeleon";
let third = `Charizard`;

// All valid values of type string
```

**Pro Tip** ðŸ’¡: While there is no difference between single and double quotes for defining your strings, the convention is to be consistent with the type of quotes you use in your javascript code (preferable single quotes ðŸ˜›). Backticks help you create something called template literals.

Let's say we need to print the first name (stored in a variable called `firstName`) and the last name (stored in a variable called `lastName`) as a single name. To concatenate two strings, we can use the `+` operator.

```javascript
let firstName = 'Tony';
let lastName = 'Stark';

console.log('My name is ' + firstname + ' ' + lastName); // This will print 'My name is Tony Stark' to the console.
```

However, with template literals, we can directly replace the variables inside the string! This type of value replacement inside strings is known as interpolation.

```javascript
let firstName = 'Tony';
let lastName = 'Stark';

console.log(`My name is ${firstName} ${lastName}`); // This will print 'My name is Tony Stark' as well!
```

### undefined

*undefined* is a rather funny value type. It denotes that the variable has not yet been assigned a value. If a variable is *declared* but not *assigned* a value, then it's value is automatically `undefined`.

```javascript
let a;

console.log(a); // This will print undefined to the console

a = 10; // Assigning a value to a

console.log(a); // a is not longer undefined
```

### Objects

Objects, objects ... objects? We'll cover this in the next section shall we? There's a lot to talk about here. ðŸ¤“

## The typeof operator

Javascript has a handy `typeof` operator that tells you what the type of value stored in a variable is.

```javascript
let a = 10;

console.log(typeof a); // this will print number to the console
```

### ðŸ•µ Test your skills!

*Think of the answer before executing it yourself, execute it and see if you got it right! Questions marked with a* ðŸš€ *are slightly tricky.*

What do you think will be the output of the following?

1)

```javascript
let a = 10;

console.log(typeof a);

let a = 'Hello World';

console.log(typeof a);

let a = 4.5;

console.log(typeof a);
```


2)

```javascript
let a;

console.log(typeof a);
```

3) ðŸš€

```javascript
let a;

console.log(typeof (typeof a));
```
